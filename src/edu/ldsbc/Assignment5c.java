     * <p>
     * Submit your code when finished to the Dropbox.  You will need to pass off the assignments with the TA during office hours (TA information is in the course section), the tutor or the instructor in class. Also, you need to follow the formatting guide which is found in the course section.
     * Read the instructions carefully.  Make sure you are outputting things as per the example.
     * <p>
     * For this assignment, you will create a program that will put members of the Church into different classifications. You will ask the user for an age and a gender.  The following conditions determine what should be printed out.
     * Age	Gender	Result
     * < 1	NA	Babe In Arms
     * >=1 	NA	Nursery
     * >=3	NA	Primary
     * >=12	Male	Young Men’s
     * >=12	Female	Young Women’s
     * >=18	Male	Priesthood
     * >=18	Female	Relief Society
     * <p>
     * An example run would look like this:
     * <p>
     * Enter Age:
     * 23
     * Enter Gender:
     * Female
     * Relief Society

        String gender = "Female";
        int age = 23;
        //what should we check first and why?
    }
}
